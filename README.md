Drop down list for the following Requirements:
a. Change the background of window to be white
b. Try to change the shape of your window mouse
c. User must interact with window using mouse only
d. Try to make combination between your console and window
e. Give me option to choose shape color before drawing from menu
f. Implement item to clear screen from shapes
g. Implement save function for all data in screen
h. Implement load function to load data from files
i. Implement line algorithms [DDA, Midpoint and parametric]
j. Implement Circle algorithms (Direct, Polar, iterative Polar, midpoint and modified Midpoint)
k. Filling Circle with lines after taking filling quarter from user
l. Filling Circle with other circles after taking filling quarter from user
m. Filling Square with Hermit Curve[Vertical]
n. Filling Rectangle with Bezier Curve[horizontal]
o. Convex and Non Convex Filling Algorithm
p. Recursive and Non Recursive Flood Fill
q. Cardinal Spline Curve
r. Ellipse Algorithms [Direct, polar and midpoint]
s. Clipping algorithms using Rectangle as Clipping Window[Point ,Line, Polygon]
t. Clipping algorithms using Square as Clipping Window[Point ,Line]
u. apply 2D transformation (translate and scale on lines) (Add 2D transformation menu with 2 menu items (translate and scale), Enter the translate x,y values or scale x,y values through console, Apply the translate or scale selected on the last line drawn before selecting theÂ transformation)
